<h1>Backtracking with Arrays – Java 🔁</h1>

This repository contains a **simple and clear demonstration of backtracking**
using **recursion on arrays** in Java.

It helps beginners understand how values are changed during recursion
and how the **undo (backtracking) step** works.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Uses recursion to traverse an array
- Demonstrates backtracking clearly (undo step)
- Shows how array values change before and after recursion
- Beginner-friendly Java implementation
- Works with any integer array

---

## 🧠 Concept Used
**Backtracking**
- Make a change
- Go deeper using recursion
- Undo the change while returning
